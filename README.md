# logfuncj
Extends SLF4j for Java 8+ functional style arguments and structured logging 

Do you want to apply structured event logging patterns in your project? 
Do you want to avoid invoking expensive methods as part of your logging unless the log level is enabled?
Do you want to keep the clutter of logging lines minimized throughout your project?

Apply logfuncj to your forehead!

I haven't written much Java for a long time.
This is an experiment to improve my familiarity with using Java 8 functional interfaces.
